Block prefab blocks players path, can be unlocked by photographing the back of it

BLOCKED:
Starts out like this. uses redMaterial for the sides and the backDecal object is an UNLOCK prompt.

Also, particleStop is playing (the particles act as the wall collider that actually stops the player)

UNLOCKING:
When the player photos the back, the prefab in general turns green and plays an animation.

redMaterial becomes greenMaterial (sides turning green)
particleStop becomes particleUnlocked (particle turning green)

The backDecal should play a material called Unlocked, you can find it in the same folder as the rest of the materials for the decals. 
It has a GIF, though idk how to play it. Theres also a MOV version in the same folder as the GIF source if that helps.

After the GIF finishes playing, the decals and particles are permanently disabled, the player can pass through

UNLOCKED:
Permanent state after being unlocked. Only the sides are left, as greenMaterial.
