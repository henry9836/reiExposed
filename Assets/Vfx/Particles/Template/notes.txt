there are shaders in the folder that are to be used for HDRP particles

if you want to have custom shapes, you need to duplicate them and hook ur particle systems up to them instead

each particle has a disabled light, this is how you get particles to generate light. If you duplicate a prefab and want to edit the light object, make sure to link it to the light that is in the prefab itself. Otherwise feel free to delete it if ur particle has no light

The way I have the particles organized is as u can see ill have the particle prefab and a folder with all the shaders they use next to it. If your particle system just uses generic shaders, u don't need to duplicate those shaders ofc
