_Urban legends subsist on mystery - they live so long as they are obscure. To be documented is their sole, absolute poison._

@reiExposed is a game about a social media influencer who gets internet clout from exposing urban legends. Armed with a lethal umbrella and your phone, you take to the city of Reimachi as Rei and fight enemies known as â€˜Myths as well as their boss, Reprisal of Flame. The game features player interaction through messages that you can leave after defeating the boss as well as a leaderboard for the best times. Additionally, there are upgrades you can buy to help you out.
